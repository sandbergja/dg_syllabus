\section{Nondiscrimination and non-harassment statement}

Linn-Benton Community College is committed to providing an atmosphere that  encourages individuals to realize their potential. We embrace diversity and inclusion of all persons. The college prohibits unlawful discrimination based on race, color, religion, ethnicity, use of native language, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, veteran status, or age in any area, activity or operation of the college. In addition, the college complies with related federal, state, and local laws (Civil Rights, Disability \& Rehabilitation Acts, Veterans Acts).

\section{Disability services and emergency planning statement}

Students who may need accommodations or special tools due to a disability or disabilities should contact the Office of Disability Services (ODS) at 541-917-4789 or Red Cedar Hall 101/103 or access information on the LBCC website (\url{http://linnbenton.edu/disability-services}.)

\subsection{Attendance}


\section{Know your rights (and responsibilities)}

LBCC students have rights: the right to free speech, the right to assemble, the right of a free press, etc. LBCC students also have responsibilities to their community: the responsibility to participate and engage in class, the responsibility to advocate for their needs (ask for help), the responsibility to support a respectful teaching and learning environment, the responsibility to treat all persons with respect, the responsibility to be truthful and honest in all work and communications, and the responsibility to follow staff directions, local, state, and federal laws. Rights and responsibilities balance together to create the best learning environment. For example, while you have free speech in the caf√© or courtyard, in class the instructor decides whose turn it is to talk and what the topics for conversation will be. Students are free to believe what they believe, but instructors may require students to learn and recite concepts, principles, or theories for a class even if the student does not believe those concepts. You play a role in creating a positive community at LBCC. 

Please review your rights and responsibilities at this link: \url{http://linnbenton.edu/go/studentrights}.

If you believe a student is violating your rights, ask to be treated with respect. If that does not cure the situation, report to Associate Dean Dr. Lynne Cox, Takena 107.

If you believe a faculty member or LBCC employee is violating your rights, please report to Human Resources, Scott Rolen, CC-108.
