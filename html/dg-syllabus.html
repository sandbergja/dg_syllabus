<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the classroom, I share as much as possible the need for critical thinkers to engage multiple locations, to address diverse standpoints, to allow us to gather knowledge fully and inclusively.  Sometimes, I tell students, it is like a recipe.  I tell them to imagine we are baking bread that needs flour.  And we have all the other ingredients but no flour.  Suddenly, the flour becomes most important even though it alone will not do.  This is a way to think about [lived] experience in the classroom.

</LI>
</OL>

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00050000000000000000">

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00060000000000000000">
Expectations</A>
</H1>

<OL>
<LI>Attend all class sessions
</LI>
<LI>Participate in discussions (if this is an intimidating context for you, talk with me and we can work on a strategy to get you involved)
</LI>
<LI>Complete all assignments

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00070000000000000000">
Grading</A>
</H1>

<P>
In order to pass this course, you must:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Attend all classes.  I allow one missed class - no questions asked - but any other absence <SPAN  CLASS="textit">must</SPAN> be discussed beforehand, unless extenuating circumstances exist.
</LI>
<LI>Complete all assignments in a timely manner.
</LI>
<LI>Complete an Education Plan and get it signed by their advisor.
</LI>
<LI>Meet with their advisor.
</LI>
<LI>Attend one event on campus that is approved by your instructor, and mention it to your colleagues at the beginning of the next class.  LBCC is a vibrant scholarly community, and I'd like you to take advantage of some of the excellent learning opportunities these events provide.  I will be posting possible events to Moodle, but feel free to suggest others to me.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00071000000000000000">
File formats</A>
</H2>
You will be creating most of your assignments in some text editor and submitting them via Moodle.  I am very flexible about which file format you use. In fact, many of the assignments are quite short, so I encourage you to use them to experiment with tools that you are unfamiliar with.  Here are some ideas:

<UL>
<LI>Typical word processor formats, such as those used by Microsoft Word and OpenOffice/LibreOffice
</LI>
<LI>PDF formats
</LI>
<LI>HTML, <SPAN CLASS="logo,LaTeX">L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X</SPAN>, LyX,  Docbook, or other typical markup languages
</LI>
<LI>Submit a link to a Google doc, YouTube video, blog post, or other online document you've created that meets the stated criteria 
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
However, there are a few formats that are a total pain to open - particularly documents created using Apple's <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Pages</SPAN> product.  Please don't submit Pages documents. If you would like to submit something in an offbeat file format not listed here, check with me first to make sure that I can access it with my tools.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00080000000000000000">
Unique features of this DG section</A>
</H1>
Like your colleagues in other sections of DG, you will be learning about campus resources and planning for a successful education here at LBCC.  However, a key part of your work at LBCC will be participation in scholarly conversations.  To prepare you for this responsibility, we will spend time thinking about research methodologies, documentation of sources, claims and evidence, novel concepts, and knowledge gaps.  During the last part of this term, we will use these discussions to inform lasting contributions to a frequently-used knowledge base, Wikipedia.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00090000000000000000">
Nondiscrimination and non-harassment statement</A>
</H1>

<P>
Linn-Benton Community College is committed to providing an atmosphere that  encourages individuals to realize their potential. We embrace diversity and inclusion of all persons. The college prohibits unlawful discrimination based on race, color, religion, ethnicity, use of native language, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, veteran status, or age in any area, activity or operation of the college. In addition, the college complies with related federal, state, and local laws (Civil Rights, Disability &amp; Rehabilitation Acts, Veterans Acts).

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION000100000000000000000">
Disability services and emergency planning statement</A>
</H1>

<P>
Students who may need accommodations or special tools due to a disability or disabilities should contact the Office of Disability Services (ODS) at 541-917-4789 or Red Cedar Hall 101/103 or access information on the LBCC website (<TT><A NAME="tex2html7"
  HREF="http://linnbenton.edu/disability-services">http://linnbenton.edu/disability-services</A></TT>.) Students who have medical information which the instructor should know, or who need special arrangements in an emergency, should notify their instructor and Public Safety (Red Cedar Hall).

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION000110000000000000000">
Know your rights (and responsibilities)</A>
</H1>

<P>
LBCC students have rights: the right to free speech, the right to assemble, the right of a free press, etc. LBCC students also have responsibilities to their community: the responsibility to participate and engage in class, the responsibility to advocate for their needs (ask for help), the responsibility to support a respectful teaching and learning environment, the responsibility to treat all persons with respect, the responsibility to be truthful and honest in all work and communications, and the responsibility to follow staff directions, local, state, and federal laws. Rights and responsibilities balance together to create the best learning environment. For example, while you have free speech in the caf&#233; or courtyard, in class the instructor decides whose turn it is to talk and what the topics for conversation will be. Students are free to believe what they believe, but instructors may require students to learn and recite concepts, principles, or theories for a class even if the student does not believe those concepts. You play a role in creating a positive community at LBCC. 

<P>
Please review your rights and responsibilities at this link: <TT><A NAME="tex2html8"
  HREF="http://linnbenton.edu/go/studentrights">http://linnbenton.edu/go/studentrights</A></TT>.

<P>
If you believe a student is violating your rights, ask to be treated with respect. If that does not cure the situation, report to Associate Dean Dr. Lynne Cox, Takena 107.

<P>
If you believe a faculty member or LBCC employee is violating your rights, please report to Human Resources, Scott Rolen, CC-108.
