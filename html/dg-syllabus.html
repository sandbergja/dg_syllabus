<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the classroom, I share as much as possible the need for critical thinkers to engage multiple locations, to address diverse standpoints, to allow us to gather knowledge fully and inclusively.  Sometimes, I tell students, it is like a recipe.  I tell them to imagine we are baking bread that needs flour.  And we have all the other ingredients but no flour.  Suddenly, the flour becomes most important even though it alone will not do.  This is a way to think about [lived] experience in the classroom.

Know your rights (and responsibilities)</A>
</H1>

<P>
LBCC students have rights: the right to free speech, the right to assemble, the right of a free press, etc. LBCC students also have responsibilities to their community: the responsibility to participate and engage in class, the responsibility to advocate for their needs (ask for help), the responsibility to support a respectful teaching and learning environment, the responsibility to treat all persons with respect, the responsibility to be truthful and honest in all work and communications, and the responsibility to follow staff directions, local, state, and federal laws. Rights and responsibilities balance together to create the best learning environment. For example, while you have free speech in the café or courtyard, in class the instructor decides whose turn it is to talk and what the topics for conversation will be. Students are free to believe what they believe, but instructors may require students to learn and recite concepts, principles, or theories for a class even if the student does not believe those concepts. You play a role in creating a positive community at LBCC. 

<P>
Please review your rights and responsibilities at this link: <TT><A NAME="tex2html8"
  HREF="http://linnbenton.edu/go/studentrights">http://linnbenton.edu/go/studentrights</A></TT>.

<P>
If you believe a student is violating your rights, ask to be treated with respect. If that does not cure the situation, report to Associate Dean Dr. Lynne Cox, Takena 107.

<P>
If you believe a faculty member or LBCC employee is violating your rights, please report to Human Resources, Scott Rolen, CC-108.
